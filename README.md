# plp-python-week-4
File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è: Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.
Error Handling Lab üß™: Ask the user for a filename and handle errors if it doesn‚Äôt exist or can‚Äôt be read.
Outcomes üéâ

By the end of this module, you‚Äôll be skilled in managing files efficiently in Python, ensuring error-free code that gracefully handles unexpected issues. Mastering files and exception handling will allow you to build strong, robust applications!
